### Neovim

The config aims to be as small as possible, simply for comfortable coding without millions of popus and alarms going off. (Startup time is about 80ms)  
There is plenty of dependencies please run `:checkhealth` to see what you need.

### i3-i3blocks and Rofi

> The [i3](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) mapping inspired by [LukeSmithxyz](https://gist.github.com/LukeSmithxyz/a7f790309ae17e00a5635dc5def05424)  
> Statusbar is [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) based on [this](https://github.com/miklhh/i3blocks-config) configuration  
> Dmenu is a hell to configure, so I use [this Rofi config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TutfIwxSE_s)
